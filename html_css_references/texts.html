<!--
font-style : italic
line-height : spaces between lines


MARGIN 
----------------
 space outside an element 
paragraph by default come with margin at top and botton around 14px


HTML Entity 
------------------
eg. (dot, tick etc)
code for special characters

p{}
-------------------

will create basic standard style for all the paragraph reducing redundant for setting font-family : Arial

1. This helps cleaning up the code increasing readibilty 
2. This reduces redundancy
3. Shows that an element can be targeted by two sets of codes 
    1. Element - X element - p
    2. Class - having class Y - class = "video-title" 
   
CSS Specifity 
----------------- 
you can see the attribute values in class are prioritized over p 
this is because of CSS property - CSS Specificity

CSS Selectors
------------------
the p , .video-descrp, .video-title are called CSS Selectors
CSS Selectors that target more specific group is prioritized 
eg. class = "video-title" is targeting more specific group of text/elements than p



TEXT ELEMENT 
targeting specific part of text
<strong></strong> - bolds text
<u></u> - underlines text
<span></span> - doesn't change much so can be used with some class to design some specific text the way we want
