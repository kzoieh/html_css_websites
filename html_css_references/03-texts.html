FONT-STYLE
font-style : italic


FONT_WEIGHT

we can choose font weight in number rather that bold etc 
like font-weight : 700; font-weight : 300; font-weight : 500;
the number corresponds to intensity choosen in Google fonts.


LINE-HEIGHT

For adding space between two lines of same paragraph
eg. line-height : 10px;


MARGIN 

space outside an element 
paragraph by default come with margin at top and botton around 14px
used to change the space between two  paragraphs


HTML Entity 

eg. (dot, tick etc)
code for special characters


p{}

will create basic standard style for all the paragraph reducing redundant for setting font-family : Arial

1. This helps cleaning up the code increasing readibilty 
2. This reduces redundancy
3. Shows that an element can be targeted by two sets of codes 
    1. Element - X element - p
    2. Class - having class Y - class = "video-title" 
   
CSS Specifity 

you can see the attribute values in class are prioritized over p 
this is because of CSS property - CSS Specificity


CSS Selectors

the p , .video-descrp, .video-title are called CSS Selectors
CSS Selectors that target more specific group is prioritized 
eg. class = "video-title" is targeting more specific group of text/elements than p



TEXT ELEMENT 

targeting specific part of text
<strong></strong> - bolds text
<u></u> - underlines text
<span></span> - doesn't change much so can be used with some class to design some specific text the way we want
