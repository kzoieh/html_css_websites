NESTING - 
------------------------------------------------------------

Concept of nesting refers to putting elements inside elements
<html>, <body>, <head> are all elememts having nesting
eg. we introduced <span> tag inside <p> tag


<head>
    has everything not visible on page
    eg. <title> - name of website shown on tab

        CSS styling using <style> even if it shows effect on elements visible on screen but itself is not vsible on screen so it is an element under <head> element.

<body>
    has everythin that is visible on page
    <p><h><button> etc are visible on page so they come under the <body> element

live server helps us to see changes in code without saving and reloading.

<link> element
        - is a void element
        - attributes (2)
             - rel : what kind of relation does it have eg. stylesheet
